A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places. Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places.\n",

    "_About the State income levels:_ State income levels and income data for the United States as a whole are included for comparison. Note that county-equivalents in Louisiana are called \"parishes\" and in Alaska are called in \"boroughs,\" and also that in Alaska census areas in the Unorganized Borough are county-equivalents. For states where independent cities are county-equivalents, the word \"city\" is included to identify the independent cities and to differentiate them from counties with identical names; the counties with the identical names have the word \"county\" following them. The word \"county\" is included in the names of counties that have names identical to the names of U.S. states or cities to differentiate them."
